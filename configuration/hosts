# entry, the keys user, ip_address, and options should be provided.
#
# user is the SSH user that should be used to connect to the machine. (ie, the
# script will attempt to connect to user@hostname
#
# ip_address is the ip other nodes will attempt to connect to this one with.
# This entry is used to generate the hosts file.
#
# options are phrases which may be provided to change the behavior of the
